- Logic:
  - Each employee is registered in the app with a unique identifier (e.g., employee ID or phone number).
  - Employees log in to the app using their credentials (email, password, or OTP-based login).
- Implementation:
  - Use Firebase Authentication or a similar service to manage user accounts.
  - Assign roles (e.g., "Manager" or "Employee") to differentiate functionalities.

2. Location Permission and Tracking
- Logic:
  - Employees must grant location access permission to the app.
  - The app fetches the real-time location of employees using the device's GPS.
  - Location updates are sent periodically to a backend server (e.g., every 10-30 seconds or based on significant movement).
- Implementation:
  - Use location services such as:
    - **Android:** `FusedLocationProviderClient`
    - **iOS:** `CLLocationManager`
  - Implement location tracking in the background to ensure continuous updates.

 3. Backend Server for Location Storage
- Logic:
  - A server stores the real-time location of each employee in a database.
  - Employee locations are updated as new data is received.
- Implementation:
  - Use a cloud database like Firebase Realtime Database or MongoDB.
  - Design a database schema:
    json
    {
      "employees": {
        "employee_id_1": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "location": { "latitude": 12.9716, "longitude": 77.5946 },
          "timestamp": "2024-12-11T10:30:00Z"
        },
        "employee_id_2": { ... }
      }
    }

4. Manager's Real-Time Map Screen
- Logic:
  - The managerâ€™s app retrieves the real-time location of all employees from the database.
  - Employee locations are displayed on a single map using pins/markers.
  - Each marker shows additional details (e.g., employee name, role, or status).
- Implementation:
  - Use mapping APIs like **Google Maps API** or **Mapbox.
  - Fetch all employee locations from the backend and display them as markers.
  - Update the map dynamically when the location data changes.

 5. Geofencing and Alerts (Optional)
- Logic:
  - Define geofences for specific areas (e.g., hotel premises).
  - Trigger alerts if an employee moves outside the geofence or remains inactive in one location for too long.
- Implementation:
  - Use geofencing libraries or APIs (e.g., Google Maps Geofencing API).
  - Create push notifications for alerts.

6. Status Updates and Roles
- Logic:
  - Employees can update their current status (e.g., "Available," "On Break," "On Duty").
  - Managers can filter employees by status.
- Implementation:
  - Add a status field in the employee database.
  - Allow employees to update their status via the app.
